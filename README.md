## **Introduction** ##

Welcome to my first milestone project, Oscars Movie Club.

Earlier this year I decided to take a leap of faith and enrolled in a Full Stack Development course, with the hopes of 
enabling myself to code and manifest my entrepreneuriel visions in the future, as well ass boradining my career-set and becoming a programmer. Up to this point in my career, I have worked in multiple sectors, retail, 
and hospitality, and am currently a full-time actor.

The purpose of this project is to show my understanding of the modules and languages I have learned, to 
implement them into a project to, showcase my skills in design and development. This project is a functional static-website, 
built mainly with HTML and CSS.

I will outline the steps I used to build the project and the philosophy used to plan the project, my sources of inspirations 
and my focus on user experience design.

Thank you for viewing my project and I sincerely hope you enjoy the project as much as I did designing and developing it.

## **UX – User Experience Design** ##

A large part of inspiration behind the planning for this project came from the "Oscars", relating to colors, gold for the statuett, and red for the famous, "red carpet=, to enable the user to have a positive familiar feel for "cinema" throughout the experience.

By keeping the user in mind throughout the design and development of the project, it would be easier to make the user experience
positive and cosistant. 

The planning of the project is broken into 5 planes, 
- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

---

## **Strategy Plane** ##

The purpose as the creator of the project was to create a space and a club for cinophiles that want to watch oscar nominated movies, to gather and get more information, to provide knowledge about oscar nominated movies, and where to find ratings and reviews of those movies.

**Creator stories**

Creator Goals

- As a creator, I want to make sure the project is easy to navigate.
- As a creator, I want create a project that relates to cinophiles, and captures their attention.
- As a creator, I want sections to be obvious.
- As a creator, I want the project to invoke a positive emotional response from users, potentially relating to something familiar within the movie industry and field.
- As a creator, I want to make sure all content on the page is relatable, from images to text and quotes, and avoid elements
from feeling random or out of place.
- As a creator I want to avoid users from feeling overwhelmed by the amount of content, 
finding a way to structure content so users do not feel put off from the moment they land on a page, but instead are pulled in, and feel intrigued. 

Having established a strategy for what I would like for my users, the most important part was to start thinking from 
the perspective of the user and how a user would feel going through the project.

**User stories**

First-time visitor goals,

- As a first-time visitor, I want to easily feel familiar and know the what the page is about at the landing page.
- As a first-time visitor, I want to easily be able to navigate, can I get back to the home page quickly, 
when I reach the bottom of a page is there some way to move forward without scrolling back up.
- As a first-time visitor, I want everything I see and read to evoke a feeling of the cinema. 
- As a first-time visitor, I want to feel as though I am progressing through the page and not feel overwhelmed or lost.

Returning visitor goals:

- As a returning visitor, I want to be able to get in contact with the creator or creators in some way, social links, or contact page.
- As a returning visitor, I want to be able to get intouch and become a member of the movie club. 

From my user stories, I am better able to come up with a conceptual idea of what the project needs in terms of features, which features have more priority.

During my initial planning for the project, I was planning to make the project bigger, with an are for reviews and comments of movies. As well as clearer and more buttons that would take me to external pages of where to watch the movies as well. This turned out to become to much with the alloted deadline. 

I chose some of my favorite movies to add in the movies section, but also popular ones to better capture and maintain user attention, as well as making it relatable. 

---

## **Scope Plane** ##

Based on the Strategy goals I can establish that trying to include everything I want, and what the users would like from the inspiration of other websites, I realised it wasn't going to be feasible from my initial release. The easiest way to approach this would be to start 
with a minimum viable product, that would answer the question that came up the most, and represent the spine of my vision.

Because of my tight deadline i had to survive and adapt based on the feeback from my mentor Harry, myself and some close friends. I didn't have time to re-approach the project from a retro-active phasing strucutre. 

My plan for a phased release would be, if I had the time,

**Phase 1** -

- A home page with a small introduction to the project.
- A Movies page.
- An about page.
- A sign-up & contact page. 

**Phase 2** -

- An expansion on the movies page, increasing the amount of movies significantly. 
- A page with movie list links from "letterboxd"
- An about us page.

**Phase 3** -

- Interactive elements, ie, better looking buttons, more buttons, and more interactive links. (I lack JavaScript knowledge)
- Web domain with a customer URL
- Built in videos and trailers.
- A news section for the newest Oscar related news.

Having a phased approach to the project allows users to feel surprised when a new version is deployed with extra elements and allows me time to collect feedback and better understand flaws with my initial design or development and to help me grow. 
Also allows me to implement new skills I have learned and build upon the initial design.

## **Structure Plane** ##

Knowing from the beginning that the project would need links to movies, and the amount of them was the biggest hurdle. How to keep users interested and to not be put off by bad link dsign. 

Sources for inspiration to overcome this came from my mentor Harry Leepz, who told me to keep it simple and tight. 

**Colours** -

- Grey
- Red
- Gold

Grey background to start with to make it more relaxing for users to read and make it less exhausting on their eyes, also blends in well with the hero image on the landing page.

This would also make the Golden text pop more. 

I decided to split the sections wit ha white smokey line, to make it feel as you're actually progressing down a page and not stay on one long page.

The red color for the header, nav bar and footer was a good color combination with the grey, and gold. But also fit well with the majorit of movie images I decided to use. 

It also gave me the option to incorporate translucent red boxes to make text and the signup form more obvious.

**Typography** –

- Aboreto
- Aldrich

I used fonts that were most similar to the Oscars titel itself. Giving off a level of recognition and familiarty but also making it look award-like. Aldrich was my choice for the bulk text, and was directly chosen because of it's likeness to Aboreto, yet keeping it less elegant, and better fitting for bulk text in my opinion. 

I decided to make a simple nav bar, that stretched bellow the header, but that dissapeared as you scroll down in order to make use of viewer space. 

Consistency with the Navigation Bar and Footer elements because they will be recurring elements, I wanted to footer fixed, in order to enable an easy way to navigate back to the top of the page.

A back to top arrow for the user, when they reach the bottom of the page, and an easy to navigate Navigation Bar at the top.

Simple Social Media Links in the footer.

Responsive across all devices, to make images scale properly and do not end up pixelated, text is readable on all devices.

## **Skeleton Plane** ##

I found wireframes difficult, and tedious to use. And instead drew a simple and plane mock-up in the so called real life. 

![Skeleton Mock-up drawing](https://github.com/Fantomen31/Oscars-Movie-Club/blob/main/assets/documentation/skeleton%20plane%20mock%20up.JPG))

There are some differences from the mock-up to the project;

- All pages got melded into one page, and become sections to navigate to rather than pages to jump to.
- Home Page got added wit ha hero image and a quote, to entice engagement.
- Header & Footer got fixed to top & bottom.
- About text got aligned to center of page rather then split up into boxes for better design and use of screen realestate.
  
- All smaller details were added in as I was building.

TLDR;
I didn't know how to utalise the skeleton plane as well as possible. This was a great learning xperience, and next time I'll spend more time to create a stronger and better mock-up to make it building easier and more compartamentalized. I did however expect my skill in ock-ups to go hand-in-hand with my coding knowledge. I.E, now I better know what I can implement, thus I better know how to create a proper skeleton mock-up for next project.

I learn best by doing, but it's important to keep in mind and reflect over the proccess to se what I can develop untill next time.

## **Surface Plane** ##

**Features present across the project,**

- Navbar – Responsive, scrolls down to chosen section. Colored red, with golden text to offset the background and mesh with rest of page design.
- The text-logo header acts also as a "refres-link" back to the home page.
- Footer – Another smaller navigation menu for the user who wishes to navigate to our social media links in a new tab, as well as an arrow that takes them back to the top of the page, rather than having to scroll up. 
- Large hero image to draw the user’s attention, accommpanied by catchy movie quote. A black and white image to represent the feeling of classic film.
- The text on the hero image has a red translucent background to help the text stand out better, and keep the full view of the image.
- Grey background for users to feel less tired while reading, also helps sections to stand out versus a white background, as well as working of the black and white hero image.
- White smoke <hr> to help user understand when they're heading down into a new section of the page. Also adds to the overall UX.
- Golden-boardered movie images to make them feel like movie posters, they're also clickable taking you to respective IMDB page in a different tab.
- Contrast of fonts between header and proceeding text, to split the headers from the bulk-text.
- Used images that mesh well with websited color deisgn, i.e, red, yellow, lightblue/grey.

**Features left to implement**

- Once I have some understanding of JavaScript, I would like to implement it into this project to make it more interactive and less static. 
- Have all interactive buttons & images increase in size on hover to let the user know it's clickable.
- Create headers for the movies with informative text of what it's about that is responsive together with the images.
- Have playable trailers on the images, that play when you hover on them. It would help the site be less static and stand out more.
- I'd like for the nav bar to be fixed together with the header, to keep the scrolling window consistant.
- Genuine Web domain and a custom URL. Would help the user experience seeing a more professional looking URL.
- I'd like two additional pages. One for our screen schedules, with information of what day, time and the location of the screening. And one page dedicated with links to movie lists from Letterboxd.

I went on to edit these errors, and commited them, then pushed them to my git repository and edits are found there, link to deployments ; (https://github.com/Fantomen31/Oscars-Movie-Club/deployments) 

After my final mentor session, Harry recomended me to add a submit.html file to direct my users from the sign-up form after submittingwith the Lisan-Al-Gaib button. Before the session it took teh user to a 404 page not found. After the session it now takes you to a simple "thank you" page.
